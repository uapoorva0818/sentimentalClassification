We saw that The Monsoon was open so headed in for a meal. They had closed for the evening but cooked us a meal for us to take away . While waiting, we were able to have a drink. As we were in a hotel room, we had no cutlery or bowls to use, so staff sorted us some plastic cutlery and two plastic take away pots for us to use as bowls. They even threw in a bottle of Cobra. They couldn't have been more helpful, in the early hours of the morning, to make sure we could eat, especially as they were probably about to head home themselves...thankyou.\nReview negative predicted by final not baseline\nYes, the previous feedback are absolutely right.

Indeed, in this case the food is exactly what you would expect from a tourist trap in Rome: average/ good but not exceptional, and definitely with a low quality/price ratio. Service was OK but the atmosphere is kinda cringe: alongside the usual fountain in the patio, and the red-and-white squares tablecloth, they also display posters of the Godfather: I loved the movies but give us a break, Italy is not just mafia!\nReview negative both thought positve\nHad dinner yesterday night at this place (one burger, a salad and some fries) and now my boyfriend and I are both sick. This really ruined our night. Such a disappointment... \nReview negative predicted by final not baseline\nThe service managers are pathetic! Avoid going, food is good but the floor managers are not good at service.\nReview postive predicted by final not baseline\nCould not recommend this restaurant highly enough!\nReview negative predicted by final not baseline\nWhilst good these are not much different from other shops. The staff are grumpy and think they’re doing you a favour by serving you\nReview negative both thought positve\nthe staff is a bit untrained and difficult to get a seat.\nReview negative predicted by final not baseline\nThe large buns have a core that is not really baked. It will be like a lump. Discovered the lump at home - therefore I did not complain on the spot.\nReview negative predicted by final not baseline\nLooks like they are not happy to work here! Very disappointed with the service and place. Will definitely share this experience and never recommend!\nReview postive both thought negative\nI am a very picky eater who dislikes pork, however, Schiller Braeu made me change my mind about German food. Before I went to Germany, I decided to eat nothing but pastry as I did in Vienna years ago. I went restaurants just to keep my husband company and only had a few bites of his meat dishes. At Schiller Braeu I learned to enjoy German sausages and potato sides. Even the sour sauerkraut in Germany was delicious, unlike what we buy from North American market. The restaurant has a very pleasant local atmosphere and the most hard-working waitresses considering how many large glasses of beer that they had to carry!\nReview negative both thought positve\nCertainly not for Asian food gourmets. Tasteless soups, uncomfortable seating, but great decor and sound track reproducing Tokyo suburb cheap joint.\nReview postive both thought negative\nOne nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8, and they didn't expect more tip than that.\nReview negative predicted by final not baseline\nIâ€™m traveling for work and my options were limited. I told them I had a nut allergy and they didnâ€™t seem knowledgeable if their items had nuts in it but â€œwould make a note of itâ€. Didnâ€™t like that at all\nReview postive both thought negative\nFriendly. Expected tagine to be pieces rather than a chicken leg. They need to sort heating out. It was cold inside. Drinks were nice. Perhaps cut the whirling dervish music.\nReview negative predicted by final not baseline\nStay away! I don't mind paying some extra for good food and excellent views, but in this restaurant you are lucky if don't get food poison! The food was uneatable and the prices were ridiculously high! Shame\nReview negative predicted by final not baseline\nWe returned here after 2 previous visits that we enjoyed and had amazing food..the 3rd time will be our last sadly. We were sent downstairs were it was cold and cramped and everybody bypassed us to the toilets. The waiter constantly hovered over us watching us and made us feel uncomfortable and like we had to rush our food. The dishes were therefore rushed and not enjoyed and felt like we had overstayed our welcome... no friendly chat or welcome just eyes watching.... shame really as we did enjoy the 2 visits previously.\nReview negative predicted by final not baseline\nThe drive to Alice's is great, but the stop is not worth it. The wait was long, the parking a nightmare, and the food was the same quality as you'd get from a drive thru window. Everything on the menu sounded good but all 5 meals that we order were obviously assembled low-grade, heat and eat food products. Denny's food is at least another star better. If I had it to do again I would've went back into town and stopped anywhere else. I'm only giving the place an extra star due to the drive and rustic building.\nReview negative predicted by final not baseline\nOverall the waiting staff are inattentive and the kitchen operation is poorly timed. It's not often that, as I sit eating my meal, all I can think about is wanting to leave \nReview negative predicted by final not baseline\nWent here because it was close to the Eiffel Tower and someone mentioned it was famous. What they didn’t mention is what it’s famous for because it’s definitely not for the food. I feel like I need to go and eat elsewhere just to get this taste and experience erased from memory. There are too many excellent choices in Paris to lose one here. Big avoid\nReview negative both thought positve\nA very nice place. Very good home flan, but tiramisu is not the best unfortunately. Someone forgot the coffee marinade in the cake. Still, it's really tasty and I recommend this place. I won't say anything about food because we didn't eat anything there.\nReview postive both thought negative\nSteak was cook just the way I requested medium rare. Service was good. It should of better\nReview postive predicted by final not baseline\nWhenever we order Schnitzel we tend to overestimate our ability to eat the huge portions and this meal was no exception. It was very nice but it left no room for a dessert. A nice touch was a group of musicians who provided pleasant entertainment. Don’t hope to get a table in the evening without a reservation. This is not the best part of Munich but don’t let it put you off dining here.\nReview negative predicted by final not baseline\nThis place has the potential to be amazing but given the bad service the whole experience is ruined.\nReview negative predicted by final not baseline\nThe service was very slow. We got our drinks after afternoon tea was served. A few of the sandwiches were stale and very basic. The sweet treats were tasty and really beautifully presented. Overall an extremely sweet, overpriced afternoon tea. The staff were lovely and very apologetic.\nReview negative predicted by final not baseline\nDefinitely less than expected!!\nReview negative both thought positve\nThis used to be a Priority-go-to even though their pesto and meatballs contained pine nuts. The staff were always very helpful and knowledgeable and we felt comfortable there. They also double check all of the orders with the chef. On our last visit we noticed some changes to the menu and an addition of  Mortadella Di Bolognawith with pistachios. This caused some discomfort for several reasons. Have not been back since.\nReview negative predicted by final not baseline\nBizarre place with lukewarm welcome\nReview negative predicted by final not baseline\nBeing living in Shanghai, i've been in several excellent cantonese restaurant i have to recon the place serve high quality food but it is quite boring in the restaurant frankly, and there is no surprise in the menu of interpretations of the classics. \nReview negative predicted by final not baseline\nthe cats are absolutely gorgeous and the place is lovely but completely not worth it for food or drink or if you’re looking for somewhere quiet. too many kids and too loud.\nReview postive predicted by final not baseline\nThis is the only pub around the area so worth knowing if you fancy a pint!\nReview negative predicted by final not baseline\nTonight I had the Elk Filet special...and it sucked.\nReview postive predicted by final not baseline\nThis small unassuming Restaurant is a tiny little Goldmine of excellence. From the moment we were welcomed to the moment we left it was wonderful. The staff made you feel welcome w\nReview negative predicted by final not baseline\nWhat a bummy place. Shut it down now. This place is a absolute disgrace. I would rather eat dog food\nReview negative both thought positve\nLong wait, but good service for the moment.  Mcdonald's staff must moov more faster.  They talk to much and work slowly!\nReview postive predicted by final not baseline\nReally nice food for alright prices\nReview negative predicted by final not baseline\nThe flavor is unbelievably wrong. I have a metal flavor stuck in my mouth from this.\nReview negative predicted by final not baseline\nTrying to be creative, definitely not authentic middle eastern food\nReview postive both thought negative\nVery professional and kind service, we took test menù was good , some dishes better than other but in general was ok, atmosphere nice but could be better. Price for what you have it’s not expensive. Compliments to the Italian girl that took care to our table.\nReview postive both thought negative\nFamily of 4 for dinner and service was very good along with quality and quantity of food. The famed US customer service has not been what I expected over the last 2 weeks but this was exactly what I was expecting, warm welcome and attentive service. Food was good quality with no complaints from two teenagers. Only downside was being charged for one of the boys playing a game on the table monitor. He said it did not warn him there was a charge and thankfully he only played one game but beware.\nReview postive predicted by final not baseline\nIt's a really cute place with two floors. Then I felt like I was back in Miami Beach with the bathroom charges at the door. The food was standard for the restaurant chain. The atmosphere was fun.\nReview negative predicted by final not baseline\nJust few words: 80€ for two plat, 2 desserts and 6 glass of wine. I like the place, really very romantic, but too much expensive for nothing special.\nReview postive both thought negative\nThey were able to provide an PA friendly meal for my son, but it was one of those situations where I had to trust that they knew what they were doing. There was no explanation, or allergen list. I chose something that wasn't likely to contain peanuts and asked them to prepare it away from peanuts. And they did. \nReview postive both thought negative\nThe 14 course or even more was just mind blowing. I couldn't have imagined this to happen again, from daulat ki chaat to samosa to galauti to crabs to shikanji and what not. Do dine at the restaurant to experience the same\nReview negative predicted by final not baseline\nJust a hec of a lot of food with little flavor…Bloody Mary best part of the meal.\nReview negative predicted by final not baseline\nPizza tasted like burned cardboard ...I expected great pizza and was very dissapointed ...\nReview postive both thought negative\nWe went in unplanned based on a high percentage of “Indian” looking customers. We were not disappointed. Food was lovely; service great.\nReview negative predicted by final not baseline\nThey were able to accomodate me, but the dish that they brought out bore little resemblance to what I had ordered. When they have to alter a dish so much, I prefer a little warning. \nReview negative both thought positve\nWe the worst experience ever! My family came to visit from Switzerland and was very happy to take them to a place with good food and nice atmosphere, but we had neither good food or nice atmosphere! \nReview negative both thought positve\nWe had my birthday breakfast at Mon Ami Gabi. The restaurant had a good gluten-free menu, I am celiac so have to follow a strict gluten-free diet. I made my server aware and she was really good. We all received our breakfasts, which were lovely. I had just taken a bite from the toast and the server came over and said that it wasn’t gluten-free toast! I was mortified. The manager came over and apologised half heartedly. And said accidents do happen! Which was no help to me, that was my birthday ruined. I was very poorly that night and I am still suffering. The whole trip to Vegas was to celebrate my birthday with family and friends. Safely to say I won’t be visiting this restaurant again. The other meals were great and were enjoyed. It’s a lovely restaurant with a great atmosphere. Recommend it, but not if you are celiac or have allergies.\nReview negative predicted by final not baseline\nLunched today and just about OK. Lovely people running the restaurant which is clearly popular with locals but certainly one we wouldn't rush back to.\nReview negative predicted by final not baseline\nWhen it comes to meat and fire, any one can do it. The pros make the experience worth the down side to your health and heart. This place poorly cooks inferior meat, joins it with soggy fries, soupy spinach, but great service. If only those friendly waiters had something worth eating to serve. If you are not mindlessly grazing and take your eats seriously, seek meat at reliable and well known locations in and around NYC. Do not waste your cholesterol intake here.\nReview negative predicted by final not baseline\nFine, I get it. You're a tourist and you have to go to that place that sells a kanelbulle the size of your head because everybody's going and you just have to try it as well. Let me save you some calories and a disappointment: it's not the best kanelbulle in Gothenburg, and not even in Haga. It's the biggest one, the most famous one, but if you care about what you eat you will look the other way and say \"not today, kanelbulle. Not today.\"And if you're smart you'll try something else or even better, go to a place where they sell kardemombulle or Stokholmknot and order one of those next to your drink and you'll know you have just beat the system and that you're better then everyone and that's just how it should be.\nReview negative both thought positve\nReservation required. A place with few seats.\nReview postive predicted by final not baseline\nWe had a jolly evening last Sunday having tried a range of both vegan and meaty plates. We also drank a remarkable white wine - Binyamina Gewürztraminer. The waitress whose name I never asked for (I only know she was Italian) attended to us with highest standards of professionalism and friendliness. I shall definitely return soon.\nReview negative both thought positve\nThis is the grossest restaurant I've had the misfortune to try.\nReview postive predicted by final not baseline\nThis is my second time and it did not dissapoint.\nReview negative predicted by final not baseline\nGood service and nice people, but the food was unexpected with the price, and i found a lot restaurants have a good food more than this restaurant. i won't back for that restaurant\nReview negative predicted by final not baseline\nAfter being in New York for a few days, it was my mission to find some really good NYC pizza. I walked past this place with my wife and she said hey look it says the best pizza. I'm a fan of marketing, so I hopped right in. First off the place was packed, (which I think this must be a great place then). When I got to the register the guy serving starts yelling at me asking what I want. Now I met a few New Yorkers already and I must say they are good people, so when this guy starts yelling at me for no reason I was shocked. I ordered my pizza and then left. Rude service. Now for the pizza review. It looked so good, just mouth watering. I took my first bite and grease just came pouring out of the pizza. That's all I tasted. It had no flavour, just grease and a pretty face. Sad to say but my best NYC pizza was at the airport getting ready to fly home. Avoid this place unless you enjoy servers yelling at you and pizza that looks pretty.\nReview negative both thought positve\nThe restaurant is cosy and the food is good. Yet, the waiting time are, by far, totally unacceptable.\nReview negative predicted by final not baseline\nI decided to try some Japanese on my visit to Florida and found this place on Yelp. The place is relatively big, service was good but the food I should have ate at a Chinese take out instead. I ordered a Beef Donburi and the portion was so ridiculously small my 4 year old won't be full. My wife ordered the Sirlion Grill which looked like a McDonalds hamburger patty. The best thing I had here was water. \nReview postive predicted by final not baseline\nTaste of the foods was awesome and I had a really good time with friends. Jone was the one who taking care of our table, appreciated his services. Thumb ups !\nReview postive predicted by final not baseline\nour visit to the 102nd floor was an absolute highlight—not just because of the views, but because of Ranita, our host in the observatory. An Empire State Building employee for 25 (!!) years, she is clearly so dedicated to her job and making visitors feel welcome. Thank you Ranita for a visit our kids won’t soon forget.\nReview negative predicted by final not baseline\nOur waitress was kind and asked about allergies but she didn’t seem to understand why bread from “a local bakery” was being questioned. The manager came out and said the bakery did handle nuts. We skipped the burger my daughter wanted to eat and she ate a sandwich we brought. Good intentions here but not somewhere I’d go again with my daughter.\nReview postive predicted by final not baseline\nWe ordered a dairy, egg, peanut free ice cream cake from here. They showed me ingredients of everything used to make the cake. The owner also is very diligent about the whole process from washing hands to not even eating anything with peanuts if she knows she will be handling food for an allergic customer. They also carry chocolates that are allergy safe (top 8). Great little store.\nReview negative predicted by final not baseline\nAs soon as they know you are a tourist they will jack up the prices. For example the price of two small crabs and 4 pieces of jumbo shrimp costed us 220 Turkish Lira and 1 KG sea bas 170 Lira\nReview negative both thought positve\nIt is my second time visiting with my husband. Should say the food is relatively good however, if you are planning to have a meal in a good environment and service, I strongly advise you to go somewhere else. Other people were complaining as well with this. If you are just looking for a place to have a quick meal by yourself, should be ok. However we won't visit this place again. Let's just say bad experience.\nReview negative predicted by final not baseline\nThe restaurant was not nearly full. Maximum 1/4th. full. We were met by a middle aged waitress, not smiling, nor friendly.\nReview negative predicted by final not baseline\nChanged the menu. Not good now\nReview negative predicted by final not baseline\nIf you like breakfast done go here,brought toast I had to get up for coffee twice I should of went to McDonald's.\nReview negative predicted by final not baseline\nThis iconic restaurant has fallen beyond recognition, the service, amenities and food leaves lots to wish for of what it was in the past.\nReview negative both thought positve\nI had the lunch menu and it was clearly not great. The burrata starter was the best but followed by a lousy US prime and a very mediocre apple tart...\nReview negative predicted by final not baseline\nThe food was average, at best. In all my years, this was the 'sweetest' butter chicken I have been served... \n0\tOver all I felt a bit disappointing with above reasons. I’d didn’t feel like an occasion dining out, just nice dining out experience\"\n",
